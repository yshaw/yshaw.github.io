During my spare time, I launched several open source softwares or projects. Here are some useful and typical projects I have developed with different purposes.
####ML-class
My solutions to programming exercises from Stanford online Machine Learning class. \[[Download](files/mlclass.rar)].  
Programming platform: _Octave_ 

####VenusDB
It's a high performance key-value storage library that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. \[[Download](files/VenusDB.rar)].  
* High performance in reading and writing sequentially or random by using hashing & B-tree indexing structure. The average time of random searching a target key in this DB is 6.2 microseconds.  
* Suport real-time inserting new k-v pairs during the searching process with a seamless update based on grouping locks of shared memory.  

Programming language: _C_ 

####TextExtract
A fast and accurate algorithm to extract contents from diverse chinese web pages such as the main body of news or blogs pages. This methods used some significant features of useful texts which can locate the main content automatically in chinese pages. \[[Download](files/StructPage.rar)].  
Programming language: _C++_ 

####DNSFilter
Secure network filter for blocking malicious domains and ips during the resolution in recursive DNS server. It's easy to deployed in server without changing the configuration or source codes of DNS software as it's implemented based on the hooking packets in kernel mode and the communication between user and kernel mode. \[[Download](files/DNSFilter.rar)].  
Programming language: _C_ 

####WebDetector
Malicious code detection of different web pages by analyzing the embedding patterns of trojan, spyware and virus in source code of web pages. \[[Download](files/WebPageDetector.rar)].  
Programming language: _C#_ 

####AIRMP3
Cross-platform MP3 player based on Adobe AIR run-time system. \[[Download](files/AIRMp3.rar)].   
Programming language: _AS3_
